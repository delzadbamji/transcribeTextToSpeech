transcribeSpeechToText / Speech Recognizer
In this project I have created a basic flask application to simulate a speech recognizer. 
The web application has a file input field which accepts '.wav' audio files.
On uploading, the model outputs the closest transcribed results. 
The results are displayed dynamically on submission. 
The output text may vary with the amount of noise in the audio clip.
A similar idea was demonstrated on a course at codex and I built this application around that theme.

Future implementation: Further on in this project, I intend to train the model over a CNN to improve its accuracy.
